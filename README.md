# SharpPeg
A C# implementation of Parsing Expression Grammars, intended to be used as a replacement for regular expressions. SharpPeg will dynamically compile PEGs to CIL, delivering performance similar to that of common regular expression engines.

# `peg-match`
The `peg-match` tool uses SharpPeg to implement a tool similar to `grep`, using PEGs instead of regular expressions.
